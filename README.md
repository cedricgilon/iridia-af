## Abstract

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained heart arrhythmia in adults. 
Holter monitoring, a long-term 2-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), is a key tool available to cardiologists for AF diagnosis. 
Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models have shown great capacity to automatically detect AF in ECG and their use as medical decision support tool is growing.
Training these models rely on a few open and annotated databases. 
We present a new Holter monitoring database from patients with paroxysmal AF with 167 records from 152 patients, acquired from an outpatient cardiology clinic from 2006 to 2017 in Belgium. 
AF episodes were manually annotated and reviewed by an expert cardiologist and a specialist cardiac nurse.
Records last from 19 hours up to 95 hours, divided into 24-hour files.
In total, it represents 24 million seconds of annotated Holter monitoring, sampled at 200 Hz.
This dataset aims at expanding the available options for researchers and offers a valuable resource for advancing ML and DL use in the field of cardiac arrhythmia diagnosis.
